Hello, I'm Ray, Im a Video game and interactive software 
development student based in mexico city

### Why video game and interactive software development?
Throughout my life nothing has captured my interest as 
much as video games.  
Ever since i was introduced to them at
the young age of 3, Games have been a central part in my life 
and i am very passionate about them.  
I hope to one day develop games that resonate with others 
as the games i have played resonated with me.

### Interests and hobbies

I Dont just enjoy video games as a past time.  
I also like working out, drinking coffee, cooking, learning about and building custom desktop 
computers, listening to new and interesting music and i also love digital art.
